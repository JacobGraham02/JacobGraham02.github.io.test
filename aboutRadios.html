                        <p class="radioDesc">You may not think much of radios, perhaps to you they are solely portable music players to use when you are bored, or big booming boxes who take up an almost-permanent spot in your living area, just waiting to be used and collecting dust. In truth, radios are much more than that! Radios come in various different forms, such as online platforms like Spotify, Worldwide FM, and Pandora Radio, embedded into your phone and car in the form of music players, and much more! The advantages of radios are many, such as the ability to listen to any type of music anywhere in the world at virtually no cost, the wide range of and excellent transmission quality of sound, and its overall attention-capturing abilities.</p>

                        <p class="radioDesc">Unfortunately, something with many pros inevitably will have cons tagged on aswell. The most pressing concern is the struggle of getting and keeping listeners like you, as there are no visual additives to keep some listeners engaged, in which they will simply tune off the radio station in search of another. If you host a radio on the internet, that's great for traffic, but not-so-great for when the internet host cannot provide. If you play advertisements on the radio, it is tougher to land advertisement deals with people like you than if done the the same on television. If these sound like a turnoff, not to worry!</p>

                        <p id="asideRadioDesc">It is true that a Radio is a gadget that works by playing music and other audio for you, but have you ever wondered how a radio <em>really</em> works? If so, below you will find what you are seeking! 
        
                        <dfn>Radio</dfn>, or sound communication via electromagnetic waves, works by transmitting and receiving electromagetic waves. The actual radio wave, denoted a 'signal', is an electric current moving back and forth extremely quickly, undetectable without the use of specialized equipment. A transmitter sends out this signal via an antenna, in which a reciever then picks up the signal and translates it to sounds heard through a radio. To receive a specific radio frequency, a radio must be tuned to a specific frequency
